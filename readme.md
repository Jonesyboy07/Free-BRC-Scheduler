A free scheduling tool for within VRML made by Jonesy and Capzay.

It uses the VRML API, in which some parts of this code are ripped from another project by *jonesy* which is not public.

In creating this, we aim to make a tool which can be used by **anyone** with simplicity in mind. 

We aim to eventually have a website made for this tool, but it will be **mainly** discord oriented.

If you wish to support us, we will provide links to do so <3
